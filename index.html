    <p><span>The World Wide Web</span> is a system of Internet servers that support specially formatted documents.</p>
    <p>The documents are formatted in a markup language called <span>HTML (HyperText Markup Language)</span> that supports <a href="http://techterms.com/definition/hyperlink">links</a> to other documents, as well as graphics, audio, and video files. This
      means you can jump from one document to another simply by clicking on hot spots. Not all Internet <a href="http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/server">servers</a> are part of the World Wide Web</p>

    <p><span>DOM - Document Object Model</span></p>
    <p>The Document Object Model (DOM) is a cross-platform and language-independent convention for representing and interacting with objects in HTML, XHTML, and XML documents.[1] The nodes of every document are organized in a tree structure, called the <span>DOM tree</span>.
      Objects in the DOM tree may be addressed and manipulated by using methods on the objects. The public interface of a DOM is specified in its application programming interface (API).</p>

      <h2 id="css">CSS - Cascading Style Sheets</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="informations">
      <p><span>Cascading Style Sheets</span> are used to format the layout of Web pages. They can be used to define text styles, table sizes, and other aspects of Web pages that previously could only be defined in a page's HTML.</p>
      <p>CSS helps Web developers create a uniform look across several pages of a Web site. Instead of defining the style of each table and each block of text within a page's HTML, commonly used styles need to be defined only once in a CSS document.</p>
      <p>Once the style is defined in cascading style sheet, it can be used by any page that references the CSS file.</p>
      <p>Plus, CSS makes it easy to change styles across several pages at once. For example, a Web developer may want to increase the default text size from 10pt to 12pt for fifty pages of a Web site. If the pages all reference the same style sheet, the
        text size only needs to be changed on the style sheet and all the pages will show the larger text.</p>
      <p>While CSS is great for creating text styles, it is helpful for formatting other aspects of Web page layout as well. For example, CSS can be used to define the cell padding of table cells, the style, thickness, and color of a table's border, and
        the padding around images or other objects. CSS gives Web developers more exact control over how Web pages will look than HTML does. This is why most Web pages today incorporate cascading style sheets.</p>

      <h2 id="repetition">Avoiding repetition when programming</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="informations">
      <p><span>Avoiding repetition</span> is important for a variety of reasons.</p>
      <p><span>Avoiding Errors:</span> When programmers don't avoid repetition, they will often have to do the same thing over and over. This may mean copy and pasting certain style attributes into many HTML elements or rewriting the same code (sometimes
        with minor differences) many times.</p>
      <p>This can lead to errors when the programmer decides to make a change to something. If they don't dilligently make that same change everywhere the repeated code appears, problems will arise.</p>
      <p><span>Consistency:</span> In this web page, I wanted every lesson to look the same. Instead of manually giving each one the same style, I was able to assign each lesson div the same class and then specify the style for that class in only one place!
        By avoiding repetion, it's now very easy for me to make changes to this style.</p>
